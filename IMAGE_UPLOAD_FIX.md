# Image Upload Fix

## Problem

Images uploaded through the admin panel were showing as broken placeholders due to incorrect path construction.

## Root Cause

The image upload system was constructing absolute URLs with `http://localhost:3000` which doesn't work properly in development mode.

## Solution

Updated the image upload system to use relative paths for all environments:

- **All Environments**: Uses local file upload (`/api/upload-local`) with relative paths
- **Path Format**: `/images/filename.jpg` instead of `http://localhost:3000/images/filename.jpg`

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Admin Upload Logic (`app/admin/page.js`)

- Simplified `uploadFile()` function to always use local upload
- Removed environment detection and Cloudinary dependencies
- Uses consistent local file upload for all environments

### 2. Simplified Upload Endpoint

```javascript
// Always use local file upload
const uploadEndpoint = '/api/upload-local'
```

### 3. Relative Path Construction

```javascript
// Use relative path for all environments
const imagePath = `/images/${filename}`
```

## How It Works

1. **File Upload**: Images are saved to `public/images/` directory
2. **Path Storage**: Database stores relative paths like `/images/filename.jpg`
3. **Image Display**: Next.js serves images from the `public` directory
4. **Unique Naming**: Files are automatically renamed with timestamps to avoid conflicts

## Benefits

- ✅ Simple and consistent across all environments
- ✅ No external dependencies (no Cloudinary required)
- ✅ Works with standard Next.js static file serving
- ✅ Automatic unique filename generation
- ✅ Proper error handling and validation

## Testing

1. **All Environments**: Upload images should save to `public/images/` directory
2. **Database**: Check that relative paths like `/images/filename.jpg` are stored
3. **Display**: Verify images load correctly in the project cards

## Next.js Configuration

No special configuration needed - Next.js automatically serves static files from the `public` directory.
